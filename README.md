# Day1
We discussed SMILES notations, understood how to use RDKIT to generate two-dimensional structures of molecules.
#Day2
Discussed the notations further, for ring structures and charged molecules.

I hope this forms a basic understanding for the reader about the SMILES notation and how one can use RDKit to draw and visualise the structures of molecules using SMILES. The codes are pretty straightforward and self explanatory. I have attached the google colab gist in here.
